# Changelog

Each release records the vpay range it was verified against, which skills
changed, and — the section worth reading — **any claim that stopped being true**,
so someone upgrading can find the thing that will break them.

Releases are named for the date of verification and the vpay commit verified
against, because vpay publishes no release tags and its workspace version has
never moved off `0.1.0`. See [VERSIONING.md](VERSIONING.md).

## v2026-09-16-f063ee96 — first release

Verified against vpay [`f063ee96`](https://github.com/vaam-apps/vpay/commit/f063ee9647867699f3b12622a62ac0004609373b)
(2026-09-15), the commit that recorded vpay's first settlement against a real
MTN sandbox.

Twenty skills, covering all 23 pages in vpay's `docs/flows/`.

### Claims that stopped being true

Nothing yet — this is the first release. Future entries go here, in the shape:

> `vpay-merchant-api` said `POST /v1/refunds` was unrouted. Routed since
> `<date>` (`#<PR>`). If you generated code against the old claim, it 404'd.

### Known to be true only of this commit

Called out because they are the claims most likely to age, and an agent on a
different tree needs to know which ones to re-check first:

- **One real rail call has ever been made** — a EUR `mtn_momo` intent settled
  against MTN's sandbox on 2026-09-15. Orange has never been called. Before
  `f063ee96`, no real rail call had been made at all, and
  `docs/runbooks/live-sandbox-test.md` and `config/application-live.yml` did not
  exist.
- **`mtn_momo::refund` is the workspace's only `NotImplemented` token.** It was
  eight on 2026-09-03.
- **`just verify` is twelve gates.** This count has been wrong in vpay's own
  prose at nearly every value it has held — three, five, seven, nine, ten,
  eleven. Read the `verify` recipe, not any document.
- **`rust-toolchain.toml` pins `1.98.0`** — it was `1.95.0` until 2026-09-05.
- **`@vpay/ui` was deleted on 2026-09-12**; both apps compose the published
  `@vaam-apps/ui`. On an older tree the package exists and is imported.
- **`vpay-server` is one binary with three modes** since 2026-09-07 (issue #77).
  It was two binaries and two images before that, and the retired
  `ghcr.io/vaam-apps/vpay-worker` package still answers a `docker pull`.
- **`schemas/vpay.cstack` compiles into `vpay-db`** since 2026-09-06. Before
  that a syntax error in it was not a build failure.
- **The schema drift constants are 190 changes over 25 relations**, read from
  source on 2026-09-16 rather than re-measured.
